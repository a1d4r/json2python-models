        - [X] Data variant merging
        - [X] Create and register models
        - [X] Merge meta-models and extract common ones
            - [ ] Strict mode
        - [X] Save meta-models as python code
            - [X] typing code generation
                - [ ] (Maybe in future) Extract to another module (by serializers for each dynamic typing class)
            - [X] attrs
            - [X] dataclasses
                - [ ] post_init converters for StringSerializable types
            - [ ] generate from_json/to_json converters
        - [ ] Model class -> Meta format converter
            - [ ] attrs
            - [ ] dataclasses
        - [ ] Implement existing models registration
            - [ ] attrs
            - [ ] dataclasses
            - [ ] Decorator to mark class as exclude from models merge
        - Other features
            - [ ] Nesting models generation
